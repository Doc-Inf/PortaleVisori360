Interesting facts about the human body:
- An interesting fact, people who live in cities have more hair in their noses than those who live in the countryside, and it’s thicker and stiffer. 
- 8 to 30% of people around the world gnash their teeth while sleeping – it’s called bruxism.
- There are about 40,000 bacteria in the human mouth, but most of them aren't harmful. 
- An adult person performs around 23,000 inhalations and exhalations a day.
- When sneezing, the speed of air flow reaches 60 miles per hour!
- Our heart pumps around 182 million liters of blood during our lifetime.
- The cornea and lens are pretty much collective lenses, so they invert the image when it reaches the retina of the eye. 
- 100,000 chemical reactions occur in our brain every single second.
- When a person swallows, the larynx usually closes in order to prevent food from getting into the respiratory tract. But while talking, the larynx might remain open.
